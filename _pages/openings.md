# Open positions

We are always looking for enthusiastic students and postdocs to join the group! You will have the chance to do cutting-edge theory research in quantum optics and quantum many-body physics. You will also have a chance to collaborate with leading experimental groups around the world!


### PhD Positions

**We currently have funding for two new PhD positions. See our flyer.**

If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student, please send me an [email](mailto:sahand.mahmoodian@sydney.edu.au).
