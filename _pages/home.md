Welcome to the website of the Quantum Optics Theory Group at The University Sydney! As our name suggests, we are a quantum optics theory group working at [The University of Sydney](http://sydney.edu.au) in the [School of Physics](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/schools/school-of-physics.html). The group is led by Sahand Mahmoodian who is an Australian Research Council Future Fellow. 

Our research is chiefly focused on understanding quantum many-body phenomena in quantum optical systems. These systems can be used to create new quantum states of light which can be useful for quantum technologies.

Our group develops and uses theoretical and numerical methods to understand and exploit quantum optics systems composed of many atoms. We work closely with experimental groups around the world to realise new quantum states of light, and new quantum many-body physics with photons. We are interested in answering fundamental physics questions in quantum optics and using our understanding in this area to help build new quantum technologies. For more information see our [Research](/research) page

Our group is located at The University of Sydney, Australia's oldest University. It has a beautiful campus and is located in one of the most beautiful cities in the world! 

We are part of the larger Quantum-Theory group in the School of Physics.
